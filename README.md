# Project 

The project is divided into several phases.
After the fist stage of sensor testing and related library studies the idea is to use a local web server (on the ESP32) to read the data from LAN. This will also help analyze the ideal position to put the sensory box. The web server is an asynchronous web server built using the [ESPAsyncWebServer library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) so the sensor reading is update automatically without the need to refresh the web page. 
The third phase consists to allowing alexa to read temperature with [Sinric](https://sinric.com/login?returnUrl=%2F). This will also allow us to control EPS32  outputs through Alexa vocal commands.
The most important step is to create a LAMP web server on Raspberry Pi and to use it to publish data.
