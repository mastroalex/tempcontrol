# Environmental conditions measurement unit

The purpose of this project is to create a station for monitoring the environmental conditions for home. The device will be open source and based on Arduino and NodeMCU.

# Project 

The project is divided into several phases.
After the fist stage of sensor testing and related library studies the idea is to use a local web server (on the ESP32) to read the data from LAN. This will also help analyze the ideal position to put the sensory box. The web server is an asynchronous web server built using the [ESPAsyncWebServer library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) so the sensor reading is update automatically without the need to refresh the web page. 

The third phase consists to allowing alexa to read temperature with [Sinric](https://sinric.com/login?returnUrl=%2F). This will also allow us to control EPS32  outputs through Alexa vocal commands.

The most important step is to create a LAMP web server on Raspberry Pi and to use it to publish data. This also allows us to integrate several EPS32s (e.g. for different rooms) into a single web server.

In the following image the block diagram for final configurations:

To avoid overloading the LAN network, a radio communication system between raspberry and ESP32 could be developed. Or a radio link could be created between two ESP32s (or any other board similar to Arduino).

Finally all the sensors and the relative esp32 will be soldered on a board and the project will be enclosed in a 3d printed case. It is not excluded that the project will also be transferred to a customized pcb.

A last possibility is to open the firewall ports and allow access to the webserver remotely.
